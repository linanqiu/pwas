\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Pairwise Covariance}

We want the covariance ($cov$) of diseases $x$ and $y$ for all diseases in the database. Furthermore, these covariances are split by sex $s$ and age ranges $a_l$ and $a_h$.

Diseases $x$ and $y$ are specified using ICD codes. Sexes $s$ are either $female$ or $male$, and $a_l, a_h$ specify lower and upper bound ranges (ranging between 0 and 100). In other words, a query for the covariance of disease with ICD code 100 and ICD code 200 for females aged between 10 and 25 would be:

\[cov(100, 200, female, 10, 25) = 0.25\]

indicating a covariance of 0.25.

\subsection{Covariance Matrices}

We also want covariance matrices for all possible diseases
